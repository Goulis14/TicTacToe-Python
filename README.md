# Python Tic Tac Toe Game

**This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. The code offers a command-line-based two-player gaming experience with the following features:**

**Gameplay:** Enjoy a traditional Tic Tac Toe game where two players take turns to mark 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 grid.
**Interactive Interface:** Players interact through the command line, selecting positions using numbers from 1 to 9 to place their symbols.
**Validation:** Input validation ensures that players can only choose valid positions on the board.
**Win Detection:** The game detects and announces the winner by checking rows, columns, and diagonals for matching symbols.
**Tie Detection:** In the event of a draw (tie), the game announces it to both players.
**Replay Functionality:** Players can opt to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.

The code structure consists of modular functions, facilitating easy readability, maintenance, and potential expansion. It utilizes simple Python logic and arrays to manage the game's flow and state.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use this code as a foundation to understand and create your own Python-based games!
